# Blood-Cell-Image-Classification-for-Detecting-Malaria-using-CNN
  
  (1) Malaria is a serious disease that can make humans ill and sometimes it becomes a fatal disease that leads people to die. 
It is caused by a parasite that commonly infects a definite type of mosquito. 
Its symptoms are quite similar to normal flu so it is necessary to know accurately whether a person is malaria-infected or not. 
In our project, we will try to proposed a model that makes an assumption about which people are infected in terms of their symptoms.  

  (2) We will try to illustrate a model with the help of deep learning (Like: Convolutional Neural Networks) or classification algorithms 
(Like: Supervised Machine Learning) for justifying the dataset. 

  (3) We have collected the dataset from Kaggle but the data is originally from National Library of Medicine (NLM). 
 The dataset includes more than 27,000 images in which half of the images for ‘Uninfected’ and other half for ‘Parasitized’ patients  
 
  (4) Moreover, our project may takes the initiative to justify non-contagious malaria-infected person with an appropriate accuracy in this present day.
